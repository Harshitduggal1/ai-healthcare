## Getting Started

To set up Nexaura.ai locally, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **bun** (for fast builds and package management)
- **PostgreSQL** (Neon or local instance)
- **Stripe** (for payment handling)
- **Google API** (for medical and diagnostic features)
- **Clerk** (for authentication)

### Installation

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harshitduggal1/ai-healthcare
cd ai-healthcare
bun install
```

Next, set up the environment variables in a `.env` file:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://Nexaura_owner:password@host/Nexaura?sslmode=require"

NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=Nexaura.ai
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key

NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
```

Once you've set up the environment variables, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Database Setup

We are using **Neon PostgreSQL** as our database service, which supports advanced features like autoscaling and high availability. Prisma is used as the ORM for managing database migrations and queries.

To set up the database schema, run the following command:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

You can view and interact with the database using Prisma Studio:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```
